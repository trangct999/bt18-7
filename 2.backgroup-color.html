<h2>The composition of Seawater</h2>
<p>Alomost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissalved materials from Earth's crust as well as materials released from arganisms. The most important components of seawater that influence file forms are salinity, temperature, dissalved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as in their influebce on marine life.</p>
